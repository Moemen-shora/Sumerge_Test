# Sumerge_Test

## Description
Sumerge_Test is a software testing project designed to validate the functionality and reliability of a web application. The project is built using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, and TestNG for test execution and reporting.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/test/java/`: Contains the test cases and test suites.
- `src/test/resources/`: Contains configuration files and test data.

### Design Structure
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: This design pattern is used to create an object repository for web elements. Each web page in the application has a corresponding page class, which contains the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.
  
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Selenium is used for automating the web application for testing purposes. It interacts with web elements, simulates user actions, and validates the outcomes.

- **TestNG**: TestNG is used for managing test execution. It allows for creating test suites, running tests in parallel, and generating test reports.
